- All GraphElement objects (Node and Edge) have tags and attributes and form a PropertyGraph
- A SchemaNode is a Node with an attribute value of the tag name set for a given attribute key
- A SchemaEdge is an Edge tagged with a given tag name
- A SchemaGraph is a Graph with SchemaNode nodes and SchemaEdge edges
- A HierarchalGraph is a PropertyGraph with a SchemaGraph reference for computing implicit tags
- Graph extends HierarchalGraph and adds no new functions (just a rename)
