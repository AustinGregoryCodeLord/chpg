# SPGQLite
Structured Property Graph Query Language/Light

This is a lightweight graph database for storing property graphs (attributed, multi-relational graphs). Like [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), which serves as an embedded database that can be serialized to a single single cross-platform file format, SPGQLite is a queryable in memory graph database that serializes to a single cross-platform file format. The graph APIs and query language mimic much of the design and user experience of the [Atlas](http://www.ensoftcorp.com/atlas) program graph and query language, but is not specific to code property graphs.
