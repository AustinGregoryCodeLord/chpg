Naming is hard...

Logical Hierarchy Idea:
	- Graph (no tags, only attributes)
	- PropertyGraph (with tags, flat hierarchy)
	- HierarchalPropertyGraph (with tags that have a hierarchy defined by a simple "Graph")

Cons: The name "Graph" is simple to type but saving that for the final type is weird as far as naming goes
Idea: Save "Graph" for the HierarchalPropertyGraph and create a new "Schema" type that implements a simple flat labeled node only graph
